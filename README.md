## Purpose
After investigating and surveying on the sEMG decomposition, especially on Delsys dEMG device, I have several idea on such a field from a view of signal processing. 

## Study Steps
1. Get the source signal data.
    I am going to use Matlab Hardware Supported Package -- NI-DAQmx, because dEMG device is based on NI-DAQ device.
2. Basic comparison between normal sEMG(Delsys wireless) and dEMG device from seveal aspects, especially on Wavelet and HHT methods.
3. Design mean MUAP as the mother wavelet.
    Try to obtain the peeling results with Wavelet Transformation.
4. Find an suitable application to verify the method.

## Conclusion
Sorry, mess thought in my mind. 
I need re-think a lot.
